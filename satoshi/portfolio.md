## Current Problems

## UX logic

### Entities

Three levels of separate entities (Profile, Account, Portfolio) is complex and hard to understand for new users.

I propose having a single cross-service **profile** (user account) with an option to have one or multiple **protfolios** which consists of one or many **assets**.
