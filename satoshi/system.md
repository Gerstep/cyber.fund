# /system/Ethereum — Recommendations

## General
Correct approach for building high-performance cross-platfrom service would be to modularize various logical blocks on the website in order to minimize code duplication and simplify UI by unifying it.

My recommendation would be to first split current /system/ page layout into contextual blocks, then come up with the most efficient way of displaying information within the block (taking into account both layout of this page and all other target pages to display a specific block). Once complete, it would make sense to create a page layout that would include required blocks based on following product goals:
* User target action — what do we want user to do on the page
* Usability and ease-of-use
* Elegance and design

Page composition should also reflect the cross-site blocks, such as list of crowdsales, top performers or any other highly valuable information that would increase overall engagement and depth of site exploration.

Please, take a look at the list of blocks that a typical page would be composed of.
