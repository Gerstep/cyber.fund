# /system/Ethereum — Recommendations

## General
Correct approach for building high-performance cross-platfrom service would be to modularize various logical blocks on the website in order to minimize code dublication and simplify UI by unifing it.

My recommendation would be to first split current /system/ page layout into contexual blocks, then come up with the most efficient way of displaying information whithin the block (taking into account both layout of this page and all other target pages to display a specific block). Once complete, it would make sense to create a page layout that would include required blocks based on following product goals:
* User target action - what do we want user to do on the page
* Usability and ease-of-use
* Elegance and design
