        Systems in cybernomics have very simmilar to traditional economy lifecycle.
<br/><br/>
        They are born and die.
<br/><br/>
        On diferent stages of lifecicle they have very different properties that could define risks and growth potential.
        <br/>So scoring and evaluation criteria is very different for stages. Details could be found in
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cyberFund/cyberrating/blob/master/scoring.md">Scoring document</a>
        As defined in a paper <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cyberFund/cyberrating/blob/master/paper.md#2-approaching-problem-of-definitions">cyber•Rating: Cryptoproperty Evaluation</a> there are two types of systems in cybernomics: DAOs are driven by tokens that we use to call cryptocurrency and DApps are driven by tokens that we use to call cryptoassets. Key difference between this two types of organizations is in phisical network of computing, storing and transmiting nodes. DAOs have its phisical network infrustructer, though Dapps don't and use infrustructure of parent system, so they kinda of virtual. Good analogy is States that have legal systems and Companies that depend on it. Thus evaulation criteria and risks are differs

          Turnover calcalated as Daily Trady Volume / Cap
          Turnover grade is a key component of Rating calculation
          We use the following grade system: <br>
          - Illiquid grade if daily turnover is 0%<br>
          - Very Low grade if daily turnover is less 0.01%<br>
          - Low grade if daily turnover is greater 0.01% and less 0.1%<br>
          - Normal grade if daily turnover is greater 0.1% and less 0.5%<br>
          - High grade if daily turnover is greater 0.5% and less 2%<br>
          - Very High grade if daily turnover is greater 2%

      Cap in $
      {{#tooltip}}
          Cap is calculated as Tokens Outstanding * Last Price
          Token Outstanding are tokens created without difference who control them: founders, users or an organization itself. That is approach simmilar to how existing finance works.
          Cap is a key component of ratingCap. We use the following grade system:<br>
          - Pico grade if cap is less $10k<br>
          - Nano grade if cap is less $100k<br>
          - Micro grade if cap is less $1M<br>
          - Kilo grade if cap is less $10M<br>
          - Mega grade if cap is less $1B<br>
          - Giga grade if cap is less $1B

          If initial price has been appeared during public transparent crowdfunding capmaign avarage Crowdfunding price used as AIP. If the first price appeared as result of a placment to an exchange avarage price of the first trading week is being used for AIP calculation.
          In case of Bitcoin we use Coindesk BPI index. In case of Crowdfunding we use our personal tracking. In case of other currencies and assets we use Coinmarketcap data and if data is incorrent we use historical data from an exchange of a first placement.
