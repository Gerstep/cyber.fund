            <br>

            <p> The existing blockchain economy has market capitalization of {{readableN cap_btc_mln 1}}  M.
                <!-- Calculate precise total cap in BTC -->bitcoins or {{readableN cap_usd_bln 2}} B.
                <!-- Calculate precise total cap in USD --> US dollars. It is
                a result of the evaluation of {{cap.autonomous}} <!-- Calculate total DAOs -->
                decentralized autonomous systems and of {{cap.dependent}} <!-- Calculate total DAppss -->
                decentralized applications that are built upon them. We call this
                new blockchain economy cybernomics. This economy is permissionless, global,
                tax-free, and could be programmed to perform autonomously
                and at low costs any operations. Any kind of values could be created, any kind
                of organizations could be programmed. The traditional world economy
                has more than 1B business entities. The blockchain technology
                could be easily adopted by majority of the traditional business entities in 10 years
                as there is no need for special hardware, adoption costs are low.
                The low-level public infrustructure blockchain systems such as <a
                        href="https://cyber.fund/system/Ethereum" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>,
                <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/BitShares" target="_blank">BitShares</a> and
                <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/Factom" target="_blank">Factom</a> have been launched recently. <a
                        href="https://cyber.fund/system/MaidSafeCoin" target="_blank">SAFE
                    Network</a> is coming. Private blockhains <a
                        href="http://cybertalks.org/t/exausted-list-of-permissioned-blockchain-solutions/330" target="_blank"></a> are to take off.</p>

            <p>In 3 years we expect an explosion of interest to decentralized
                systems and decentralized applications from developers and
                investors. This will open doors to huge investment opportunities that have never existed before. We think that now a market share of blockchain investment
                services is roughly 1/200 of cryptonomics that is  {{readableN cap_btc_div_200k 0}}k
                <!-- Calculate total Cap in BTC / 200 and round to thousands-->
                bitcoins. However, there is a huge growth potential far beyond than <!-- Calculate total Cap in BTC / 200 and round to thousands * USD--> USD. Today there is no entities that focus on professional
                services in this niche. We suppose that in the future
                all existing public companies that are listed on
                exchanges with a cap at roughly $100T will be re-engineered using
                blockchains. That is approximately $500B niche of investment services that we are going to provide but which don't
                exist yet. At current pace of placement campaign cyber•Fund cap
                is {{readableN invcap 0}} BTC<!-- current cyberFund cap --> that is {{nicheShare}}
                <!-- Current share in niche --> of already existing niche.</p> That proportion reflects potential for cyber•Fund growth in case of providing superior services.

            <p>cyber•Fund founders has unique experience in blockchain
                investments. Some of us was early bitcoin miners in 2011. In 2013
                we focused on investing our bitcoins into prominent blockchain
                projects. Since, we created first two in its kind private equity
                funds <a href="https://cyber.fund/@satoshi_fund" target="_blank">Satoshi•Fund
                    2013</a> and <a href="https://cyber.fund/@satoshi_fund_14" target="_blank">Satoshi•Fund
                    2014</a>. This year we are working on cyber•Fund investment
                service to solve problems we suffered from. Next 6 months we are
                going to focus on lean, short cycle open source development of
                tools for blockchain developers which enable investors make
                decisions powered with high quality personalized information. As
                result we will deliver precise, real time and existed analytics
                and personalized recommendations that was just impossible for
                traditional markets. If our assumptions prove viable we will
                focus on developing decentralized investment protocol on top of
                existing service and community. That is when we are going to
                have a public offering.</p>

            <p>Eventually we dream to bake all this data with advanced machine
                intelligence using decentralized motivated computational
                network that is intelligent enough to maximize earnings for you.</p>

            <h4 class="center">FAQ</h4>
            <h5>Yet another cryptocurrency?</h5>

            <p>Definitely not. cyber•Fund is a private blockchain entity that
                operate under domain cyber.fund. Tokens represent rights defined
                by Genesis Agreement. Please, read this 1 page document
                carefully, before investing.</p>
            <h5>How I can check that you don't cheat me with onsite revenue?</h5>

            <p>Simple enough! We call it proof-of-revenue mechanism. All
                revenue addresses will be embedded in site's code. All code is
                opensource. <a href="https://github.com/cyberFund"
                               target="_blank">Check it</a>. Every deploy to
                production will be signed, hashed and notary proof using
                proof-of-existence mechanism will be put on a blockchain. Thus
                you can be sure that any time somebody send us some bits for
                services, money would not pass by. They just simply could not.
            </p>
            <h5>Does your entity centralized?</h5>

            <p>Kind of. Majority of tokens are under control of founders. Like
                in traditional startups. But we cannot control tokens as tokens
                are accounted by Bitcoin blockchain using Open Assets protocol.
                Also our code is open sourced. The truth is that domain based
                businesses, even Google, cannot be decentralized as domain names
                are managed by centralized organization ICANN. Though a lot of
                factors that define bussines model of internet company are
                binded to domain. It is a brand, a source of organic traffic,
                etc. A lot of operations we do at this point of time just don't
                have decentralized answers. Once we will find them with help of
                Ethereum, IPFS, SAFE Network or whatever else we will just move
                there! And you will be with us!</p>
            <h5>But why you call your service decentralized?</h5>

            <p>We don't control your money. Thus we can gather a lot of people
                who will prove for each other that they own funds and addresses.
                That will allow to gather huge amount of assets under management
                without dependence on any technology except of public/private
                key cryptography in such a way no single entity would not
                control. So investment could be guided by a service in a truly
                decentralized fashion, but with efficiency that is unachievable
                for any centralized funds or entities that are exist today. You
                can think of it as fund of funds. If cyber.fund domain one day
                disappear all investors will stay with money they own. Rrrrr!
                Cool! Decentralized, doesn't it?</p>
            <h5>Why are you selling so few?</h5>

            <p>Because at this point of time we don't want to sell more than 3%.
                We already put a lot of efforts in a projects, as well of
                resources. All that has been done was self-funded. Our burn rate
                is quite lean, but business model is not established. Such
                project is hard to capitalize. So if we will try to sell more
                that will be unprofitable for us. We are here for doing
                business. Do you? Best practice for startups in such cases to
                find angels: Guys who will help to reach product/market fit. So
                by this placement we are putting traditional approach on a new
                blockchain crowdfunding rails. Thus we could attract few guys
                who interested in our product as users and investors. We believe
                that such guys will help us to reach product/market fit better
                than any angel from a Silicon Valley.</p>
            <h5>Why minimal investment is 1 BTC?</h5>

            <p>As mentioned above the key goal is not only in funding itself. We
                want to attract some people who are interested in project but
                seriously enough.</p>
            <h5>When tokens will be tradable?</h5>

            <p>We are not going to do anything to put this tokens on exchange
                before we reach crowdsale. Remember that after placement it
                remain to be private. But we cannot stop you from trading CFUND
                tokens everywhere you want.</p>
            <h5>Who long private phase will last?</h5>

            <p>We don't know. To make crowdsale successful we need at least 10k
                happy users. Moreover we need to deliver prototype of
                decentralized investment platform we are aiming for. Now a year
                seems doable.</p>
            <h5>I have more questions!</h5>

                discuss everything about blockchains and decentralized consensus
                technologies!</p>
