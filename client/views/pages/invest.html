      <h4 class="center">Project Introduction</h4>
      <br>
      <p> Existing blockchain economy valuated exactly 20 mln. <!-- Calculate precise total cap in BTC -->bitcoins or 5 bln.<!-- Calculate precise total cap in USD --> US dollars. That is result of operations of 120 <!-- Calculate total DAOs --> autonomous networks and 37 <!-- Calculate total DAppss --> traded assets that was issued thanks to them. We call it cybernomics. This new kind of economy is permissionless, gloabl, taxfree, lowcost and could be programmed for fully autonomous cheap opertations. Any kind of values could be created, any kind of organizations could be programmed. Existing world economy counts more than 1 bln bussness entities. Blockchain technology could be easily adopted by majority of world economy in 10 years as it dont reqire special hardware infrustructure, low cost to implement and generally only require some educational efforts. Low level public infrustructure networks such as <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/Ethereum">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/BitShares">BitShares</a> and <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/Factom">Factom</a> recently has been launched. <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/MaidSafeCoin">SAFE Network</a> is coming. Technology of <a href="http://cybertalks.org/t/exausted-list-of-permissioned-blockchain-solutions/330">private blockchains</a> is going to take off.</p>
      <p>In next 3 years we expect the exploison of interest to blockchain enteties and decentralized applications from developers and investors. This opens huge investment opportunity never existed before. We suppose that market share of blockchain investment services will seek to 1/200 of its economy or routhly 100k<!-- Calculate total Cap in BTC / 200 and round to thousands--> bitcoins. However an opportunity is far beyond current $30M. It this point of time there is no entities focused on professinoal operations in this niche. Looking into the future we can imagine all 100k of existing public companies listed on leading world exchanges with cap rougly $100 trl will be reingenired using blockchains. That is appoximatly 500 bln niche of new generation investment services that we are going to provide but which dont exist yet. At current pace of placement campaign cyber•Fund cap is <!-- current cyberFund cap --> that is 1/1500 <!-- Current share in niche --> of already existing niche.</p>
      <p>cyber•Fund founders has unique experience in blockchain investments. Some of us was early bitcon miners in 2011. In 2013 we focused on investing our bitcoins into prominent blockchain projects. Since, we created first two in its kind private equity funds <a href="https://cyber.fund/@satoshi_fund">Satoshi•Fund 2013</a> and <a href="https://cyber.fund/@satoshi_fund_14">Satoshi•Fund 2014</a>. This year we are working on cyber•Fund investment service to solve problems we suffered from. Next 6 months we are going to focus on lean, short cicle open source development of tools for blockchain developers which enable investors make decesions powered with high quality personalized information. As result we will deliver pricise, real time and exausted analytics and personalized recomendations that was just impossbile for traditional markets. If our asumptions prove viable we will focus on developing decentralized investment protocol on top of existing service and community. That is when we are going to have a public offering.</p>
      <p>Eventually we dream to bake all this data with advanced machine intelligence using decentralized motivated computational network.</p>

      <h4 class="center">FAQ</h4>
      <h5>Yet another cryptocurrency?</h5>
      <p>Defently not. cyber•Fund is a private blockchain entety that operate under domain cyber.fund. Tokens represent rights defined by Genesis Agreement. Please, read this 1 page document carefully, before investing.</p>
      <h5>How I can check that you dont cheat me with onsite revenue?</h5>
      <p>Simple enought! We call it proof-of-revenue mechanism. All revenue addresses will be embedded in site's code. All code is opensource. <a href="https://github.com/cyberFund" target="_blank">Check it</a>. Every deploy to production will be signed, hashed and notary proof using proof-of-existance mechanism will be put on a blockchain. Thus you can be sure that any time somebody send us some bits for services, money would not pass by. They just simply could not.</p>
      <h5>Does your entity centralized?</h5>
      <p>Kind of. Majority of tokens are under control of founders. Like in traditionals startups. But we cannot control tokens as tokens are accounted by Bitcoin blockchain using Open Assets protocol. Also our code is open sourced. The truth is that domain based bussineses, even Google, cannot be decentralized as domain names are managed by centralized organization ICANN. Though a lot of factors that define bussines model of internet company are binded to domain. It is a brand, a source of organic trafic, etc. A lot of operations we do at this point of time just dont have decentralized answers. Once we will find them with help of Ethereum, IPFS, SAFE Network or whatever else we will just move there! And you will be with us!</p>
      <h5>But why you call your service decentralized?</h5>
      <p>We dont control your money. Thus we can gather a lot of people who will prove for each other that they own funds and addresses. That will allow to gather huge amount of assets under management without dependence on any technology except of public/private key cryptograpthy in such a way no single entety would not control. So investment could be guided by a service in a trully decentralized fasion, but with efficiency that is inachivable for any centralized funds or enteties that are exist today. You can think of it as fund of funds. If cyber.fund domain one day disappear all investors will stay with money they own. Rrrrr! Cool! Decentralized, doesn't it?</p>
      <h5>Why are you selling so few?</h5>
      <p>Because at this point of time we don't want to sell more than 3%. We already put a lot of efforts in a projects, as well of resources. All that has been done was self-funded. Our burn rate is quite lean, but bussines model is not established. Such project is hard to capitalize. So if we will try to sell more that will be unprofitable for us. We are here for doing bussines. Do you? Best practise for startups in such cases to find angels: Guys who will help to reach product/market fit. So by this placment we are puting traditional approach on a new blockchain crowdfunding rails. Thus we could attract few guys who interested in our product as users and investors. We believe that such guys will help us to reach product/market fit better than any angel from a Silicon Valley.</p>
      <h5>Why minimal investment is 1 BTC?</h5>
      <p>As mentioned above the key goal is not only in funding utself. We want to attract some people who are interested in project but seriously enought.</p>
      <h5>When tokens will be tradable?</h5>
      <p>We are not going to do anything to put this tokens on exchange before we reach crowdsale. Remember that after placemnt it reamin to be private. But we cannot stop you from trading CFDUN tokens everywhere you want.</p>
      <h5>Who long private phase will last?</h5>
      <p>We dont know. To make crowdsale succesfull we need at least 10k happy users. Moreover we need to deliver prototype of decentralized investment platform we are aiming for. Now a year seems doable.</p>
      <h5>I have more questions!</h5>
      <p>Please, come to our community forum: cyber•Talks! We are happy to discuss everything about blockchains and decentralized consensus technologies!</p>
