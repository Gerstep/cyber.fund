      <br>
      <p> Existing blockchain economy valuated exactly 20 mln. bitcoins or 5 bln. US dollars. That is result of operations of 120 autonomous networks and 37 traded assets that was issued thanks to them. We call it cybernomics. This new kind of economy is permissionless, gloabl, taxfree, lowcost and could be programmed for fully autonomous cheap opertations. Any kind of values could be created, any kind of organizations could be programmed. Existing world economy counts more than 1 bln bussness entities. Blockchain technology could be easily adopted by majority of world economy in 10 years as it dont reqire special hardware infrustructure, low cost to implement and generally only require some educational efforts. Low level public infrustructure networks such as <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/Ethereum">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/BitShares">BitShares</a> and <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/Factom">Factom</a> recently has been launched. <a href="https://cyber.fund/system/MaidSafeCoin">SAFE Network</a> is coming. Technology of <a href="http://cybertalks.org/t/exausted-list-of-permissioned-blockchain-solutions/330">private blockchains</a> is going to take off.</p>
      <p>In next 3 years we expect the exploison of interest to blockchain enteties and decentralized applications from developers and investors. This opens huge investment opportunity never existed before. We suppose that market share of blockchain investment services will seek to 1/200 of its economy or routhly 100k bitcoins. It this point of time there is no entities focused on professinoal operations in this niche. Thus an opportunity could be defined as 100k bitcoins in capitalization. Looking into the future we can imaging that all 100k public companies listed on leading world exchanges with cap rougly 100 trl usd will be reingenired using blockchains. That is appoximatly 500 bln niche of new generation investment services that we are going to provide but which dont exist yet. At current pace of private placement campaign cyber•Fund cap is 600 BTC that is 1/1500 of already existing niche.</p>
      <p>cyber•Fund founders has unique experience in blockchain investments. Some of us was early bitcon miners in 2011. In 2013 we focused on investing our bitcoins into prominent blockchain projects. Since, we created first two in its kind private equity funds <a href="https://cyber.fund/@satoshi_fund">Satoshi•Fund 2013</a> and <a href="https://cyber.fund/@satoshi_fund_14">Satoshi•Fund 2014</a>. This year we are working on cyber•Fund investment service to solve problems we suffered from. Next 6 months we are going to focus on lean, short cicle open source development of tools for blockchain developers which enable investors make decesions powered with high quality personalized information. As result we will deliver pricise, real time and exausted analytics and personalized recomendations that was just impossbile for traditional markets. If our asumptions prove viable we will focus on developing decentralized investment protocol on top of existing service and community and much more mature blockchain infrustructure that is much more easier. That is when we are going to have a public offering.</p>
      <p>Eventually we dream to bake all this data with advanced machine intelligence using decentralized motivated computational network.</p>
